Once you have python installed, you get access to the pip command.
You should run ```pip install pipenv``` to be able to install all the dependancies on a virtual environment.
Now you want to run ```pipenv shell```. That will create a virtuall environment and a Pipfile which will include any packages that you install. Now you can use pipenv to install the requirements by the command ```pipenv install -r requirementx.txt```.
